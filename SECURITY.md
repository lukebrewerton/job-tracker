# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Job Tracker is self-hosted and maintained by one person. It hasn't had a tagged release
yet, so only the latest `main` is supported. Once releases start, security fixes will
land on `main` and go out in a new release; older releases won't be patched separately.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please don't open a public issue, discussion or pull request for security problems.**

Report privately in either of these ways:

1. **GitHub (preferred):**
   [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/lukebrewerton/job-tracker/security/advisories/new)
   (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability").
2. **Email:** [vulnerabilities@job-finder.dev](mailto:vulnerabilities@job-finder.dev),
   if you'd rather not use GitHub.

Helpful things to include:

- The affected commit
- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce, or a minimal proof of concept
- Any relevant configuration (redact secrets)

### What to expect

This is a personal project maintained in spare time, so the timelines below are
best-effort rather than guarantees:

- **Acknowledgement:** within 7 days.
- **Initial assessment:** within 14 days, confirming whether the report is accepted
  and roughly how severe it is.
- **Updates:** at least every 14 days until it's resolved.

**If accepted:** I'll work on a fix privately in a GitHub security advisory, and may
invite you to collaborate on it. Once the fix is on `main`, the advisory is published
(with a CVE requested through GitHub where appropriate) and you're credited unless
you'd rather not be. Please keep the details private until then. I aim to disclose
within 90 days of the report.

**If declined:** I'll explain why, for example that it's out of scope, can't be
reproduced, or is intended behaviour. You're welcome to come back with more detail.

### Scope

In scope: the code in this repository (API, web UI, auth and session handling) and the
Docker image and Compose files it ships.

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies with no project-specific impact. Report
  those upstream; Dependabot tracks them here.
- Problems caused by how a particular instance is deployed or configured (weak
  secrets, an over-broad email allow-list, a misconfigured proxy or OIDC client).
- Denial of service through volumetric traffic, social engineering, and findings from
  automated scanners with no demonstrated impact.
